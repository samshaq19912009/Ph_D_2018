% The original template (from Trevor) had a custom \appendix command,
% but I found it to break figure/table counters. I'm not sure how
% reliable my fix is, so I ended up reverting back to the standard
% latex version, and renaming the custom command to \myappendix.  You
% can try both and see how things work out:
% 1) Call \appendix once, and then make each appendix a \chapter
% 2) Call \myappendix once, and then make each appendix a \section.

\appendix
