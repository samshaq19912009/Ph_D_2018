  I would like to express my deepest appreciation to Professor Ilya Krivorotov. It is quite a privilege to work with him. I really learned a lot from his great knowledge of physics and sharp insights into problem solving. I still remember almost six years ago I had my first Skype interview with Ilya and he asked me about exchange bias effect. Without his guidance and help this dissertation would not be possible.
  
  I would also like to thank all my lab mates : Zheng Duan, Igor Barsukov, Eric Montoya, Brian Youngblood, Yu-Jin Chen, Andrew  Smith,  Han Kyu Lee, Jenru Chen, Jieyi Zhang,  Alejandro Jara, Chris Safranski and Josh Dill. I have been received a great amount of help since the first day I joined the lab. When I first joined the lab, I did not know even most simple thing, such as using a torque wrench and basis soldering. These guys helped me overcome a lot of difficulties and provided help whenever I asked. I never wished I could be surrounded by such a amazing group of people and I really feel honored to call these guys my lab mate.
  
  During the last five years in the United States, I am happy to keep in touch with my good friends over the world. I would like to thank Jiao Li, Rui Da, Ruohui Yang, Xun Liu, Hongyu Zhu and Qingyu Zhu. Those people are all pursuing or have already obtained their Ph.D. degree and we have had lots of useful/useless discussions about our common experiences. We shared numerous joy and distress over the past five years and each one of them spent their time to listen to me venting my life(maybe too much). I might not be able to see these friends quite often and in fact, I have not met some of them for almost five years. However, their support is greatly valuable to me and I really hope nothing but the best for all of them from my heart.
  
  Of course I am extremely luck to have a loving family.
